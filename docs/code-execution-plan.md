# Code Execution Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding code execution capabilities to our chat application. The goal is to allow users to execute code snippets directly within the chat interface, particularly useful for Python and JavaScript code examples.

## Phase 1: Completed
- ✅ Implemented memoized markdown components for better performance
- ✅ Created proper syntax highlighting for code blocks
- ✅ Added code block language detection and display
- ✅ Added "Copy Code" functionality

## Phase 2: Code Block Enhancement and Basic Execution
### Step 1: Security and Sandboxing Research
- [ ] Research WebAssembly-based execution environments
  - [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) for Python
  - [JS Interpreter](https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter) for JavaScript
- [ ] Define security boundaries and limitations
- [ ] Document allowed imports/modules

### Step 2: Execution Environment Setup
- [ ] Create an execution context provider component
- [ ] Implement WebAssembly loading and initialization
- [ ] Add environment state management
- [ ] Set up dependency preloading for common libraries

### Step 3: Execution API Creation
- [ ] Design execution request/response interface
- [ ] Implement execution queue for managing multiple requests
- [ ] Create execution state machine (idle → loading → executing → completed/error)
- [ ] Add timeout handling and execution limits

### Step 4: UI Integration
- [ ] Enhance code block with execution controls
- [ ] Create output display component
- [ ] Implement error handling and display
- [ ] Add execution status indicators
- [ ] Create variable explorer for showing execution context

### Step 5: User Experience Enhancement
- [ ] Add ability to toggle line numbers
- [ ] Implement code folding for long examples
- [ ] Add execution history
- [ ] Create shareable execution states

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
### Rich Output Support
- [ ] Add support for rendering matplotlib plots
- [ ] Implement dataframe visualization
- [ ] Support HTML output rendering

### Interactive Code
- [ ] Add inline code editing capabilities
- [ ] Implement auto-save of modifications
- [ ] Create version history of code modifications

### Multi-language Support
- [ ] Add support for R language execution
- [ ] Support for SQL queries
- [ ] Add support for Julia

## Implementation Notes

### Execution Context
We'll implement an execution context provider that will:
1. Load WebAssembly modules on demand
2. Maintain execution state
3. Provide an API for code blocks to request execution
4. Handle resource cleanup and memory management

```tsx
// Example structure for execution context
interface ExecutionContext {
  state: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'ready' | 'executing' | 'error';
  execute: (code: string, language: string) => Promise<ExecutionResult>;
  abort: () => void;
  clearState: () => void;
}

interface ExecutionResult {
  stdout: string;
  stderr: string;
  returnValue: any;
  visualElements?: any[];  // For plots, tables, etc.
  executionTime: number;
}
```

### Code Block Enhancements
The enhanced code block will:
1. Display language-specific controls
2. Provide execution state visualization
3. Show running time and memory usage
4. Allow interaction with execution results

### Security Considerations
- All execution will happen client-side in a sandboxed environment
- Limited access to browser APIs
- Memory and execution time limits will be enforced
- No access to user files or system resources
- Network requests will be limited to specific allowlisted domains

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Research and environment setup
- **Week 2**: Basic execution API and UI
- **Week 3**: Output rendering and error handling
- **Week 4**: Polish and edge case handling

## Future Considerations
- Server-side execution for more powerful computing
- Persistent user environments across sessions
- Collaborative code editing and execution
- Integration with external notebooks or environments
